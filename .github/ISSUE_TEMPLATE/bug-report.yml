        Thanks for helping the PyScript Packages website! üêçüöÄ

        Going through bugs and issues takes up a lot of time, so please take a few minutes to fill out all the areas to the best of your ability.

        There will always be more issues than there is time to do them, and so we will need to selectively close issues that don't provide enough information (so we can focus our time on helping people like you who fill out the issue form completely). Thank you for your collaboration!

        There are perhaps already open issues, so please take 2 minutes and search through existing ones to see if what you are experiencing already exists.

        Thanks for helping PyScript be amazing. We are nothing without people like you helping build a better community üíê!
