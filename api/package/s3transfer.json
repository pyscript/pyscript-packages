If you are planning to use this code in production, make sure to lock to a minor version as interfaces may break from minor version to minor version. For a basic, stable interface of s3transfer, try the interfaces exposed in boto3.\n\nSince boto3 related functionality requires features not provided by the browser, you won't be able to use this package properly.\n",
